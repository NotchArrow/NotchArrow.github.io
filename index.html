        <h3>Coding Journey</h3>
        <p>I'm a highschool student who found a passion for 
        programming in elementary school. I've 
        taken multiple technical classes on the subject, but 
        am primarily self-taught. While I may have knowledge 
        gaps, I consider myself a good resource for those who 
        are teaching themselves programming, so feel free to 
        reach out. I'll probably learn something new in the 
        process.</p>

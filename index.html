        <p>NotchArrowUtils is a Quality-of-Life Fabric mod 
        for the latest Minecraft versions. It is my first 
        Java project and designed to bring all of the features 
        that someone would want into one optimized and 
        customizable mod.</p>

        <p>A smaller Fabric mod, designed to set a time to join
        2b2t so that you are through the queue about 7 hours later
        when you want to actually play on the server.</p>

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <h3>Coding Journey</h3>
        <p>I'm a highschool student who found a passion for 
        programming in elementary school. I've 
        taken multiple technical classes on the subject, but 
        am primarily self-taught. While I may have knowledge 
        gaps, I consider myself a good resource for those who 
        are teaching themselves programming, so feel free to 
        reach out. I'll probably learn something new in the 
        process.</p>

        <p>NotchArrowUtils is a QOL Fabric mod for the latest
        Minecraft versions. It is my first Java project and
        designed to bring all of the features that someone
        would want into one optimized and customizable mod.</p>

        <p>A smaller Fabric mod, designed to set a time to join
